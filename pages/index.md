I am a computational astrophysicist with an expertise in the study of compact object physics through the study of numerical relativity simulations
<!-- <div class="contents"> -->

The focus of my graduate studies is related to the computation and evolution of initial data solutions to Einstein's field equations for binary compact objects such as black hole binaries, neutron star binaries, and mixed binaries consisting of a black hole and a neutron star.  This line of exploration lead to
the development of the Frankfurt University/KADATH (FUKA) suite of initial data codes based on the [KADATH](kadath.obspm.fr/) spectral solver library.
FUKA is publicly available for the benefit of the numerical relativity community and can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/fukaws/).  My scientific research
has leveraged FUKA to study the influence of mass asymmetry and spin on the (post-)merger dynamics and multi-messenger signatures of binary mergers.

I am passionate about developing codes that provide the relativity community with a reliable means to probe this extreme parameter space as well as to determine how numerical simulations of such extreme binaries can help inform the community in preparation for future multi-messenger observations. 
As of May, 2023, I am also a contributor to the [Einstein Toolkit](http://einsteintoolkit.org/) which is a publicly available framework to perform
numerical relativity simulations.  I have utilized ETK extensively throughout my graduate and postgraduate studies, so it has been a privilege to finally
become a more active member in the community.


I received my Master and PhD from [Goethe Universitaet](http://www.uni-frankfurt.de) in Frankfurt, Germany under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Luciano Rezzolla](https://relastro.uni-frankfurt.de/rezzolla/).  A summary of my publications to date can be found via my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9781-0496).
